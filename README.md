# catalina-system-app-organizer

This is a script I wrote because the Applications folder in macOS is kind of a mess by default, and I wanted to organize it a bit and hide some things I don't use.

You'll need SIP disabled to mount the root partition as writable; consult google for that.

Then modify this script to your liking and run it.
